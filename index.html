<h1>Welcome to my homepage</h1>
	
<p>This page contains links to my projects for this class down below. It also
contains this picture of a cute cat that links to other cute cat pictures! Below
that is some restaurant recommendations near WSU and a little bit of price 
comparison.</p>
	
<div class="cat">
	<h2>Super cute cat who's name I don't know so they shall be called 
	Chartreuse</h2>

<p class="desc">Not really sure what to put in this second paragraph. Look at it 
though it's all styled up and rainbowy. You can also resize the browser window
then the text will change to different colors. It's pretty neat! 
<a class="desc" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl_kuzbDFV4">Here's a link
 to how I did it with just a few adjustments made to the first way the person 
 did it!</a></p>
 
 <div class="center">
 <h2>Top Ten places to eat near WSU</h2>
 <ol>
	<li>Roosters (Their brunch is killer.)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.harphound.com/" class="textLink">Harp and Hound 
	</a>(Bias due to working there. That's also why it's the only one with a 
	link.)</li>
	<li>McDonald's (Not really that good I'm just cheap.)</li>
	<li>Virg's (Only have an hour between classes come over here.)</li>
	<li>Einstein's Bagels (Good for a meal or a sweet treat.)</li>
	<li>Jack in the Box (I mean it's 99 cents for two tacos come on.)</li>
	<li>Ruan Thai (Bit far out of the way from campus, but some of my favorite 
	Thai in all of Ogden.)</li>
	<li>The Pie Pizzeria (This one is an institution. Been around since my mom
	went here and still going strong.)</li>
	<li>Waldo's Grill (You have fifteen minutes till an exam and need something 
	right now type of food.)</li>
	<li>Waldo's Conveince (Same as the last one, but you only got five minutes
	and need a monster and food.)</li>
 </ol>
